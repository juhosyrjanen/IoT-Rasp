"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this
in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings
he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to
myself—the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking,
in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It's dangerous. Besides,
I ain't insured."
This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one
side as much as to say—"I won't touch a leg of ye."
"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."
I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate
manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little
parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth
of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea
unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his,
I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did
 when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by
 the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging"""
